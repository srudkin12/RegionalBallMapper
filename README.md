# RegionalBallMapper
Code and data for the workshop on Ball Mapper in Regional Science held on 14th July 2022

There are 4 sessions within the workshop:

Session 1 introduces Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper and has accompanying slides as Session 1.pdf

Session 2 is an open session in which we will present examples of the use of Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper and evaluate potential uses within regional anaysis. There are no files to accompany Session 2 currently.

Session 3 is the primary practical session for applying Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper in R. There are two parts to the session, Part A and Part B. There is a commentary and .txt file of code for each part. There is also a Session 3.ipynb Google Colab document which you may open in a browser if you do not wish to run R on your own computer. To support the practical session there is a dataset, region1.csv, which should be downloaded to use with the session.

Session 4 is designed as an optional session and gives participants the chance to apply Ball Mapper on their own data. There is also a short session on the consideration of regression models. A commentary file, code file and Google colab link are available.

After Sessions 3 and 4 the slides used in the discussion will be made available. 

Relevant elements of the presentations from all sessions will be recorded and made available in the weeks following the workshop. The video of the workshop is available via: https://video.manchester.ac.uk/faculties/dcfc56d26eb49a4a9b05f8883bae189f/9160c512-d713-41fb-a8a5-99e014ac9d96/
